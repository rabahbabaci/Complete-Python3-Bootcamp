This repository contains my personal solutions, notes, and exercises from the [**Complete Python 3 Bootcamp**](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) course on Udemy by **Jose Portilla**.

I'm documenting my progress here to reinforce my understanding of Python, track my learning journey, and build a clean, version-controlled portfolio.

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

This is more than just course notes — it’s a personal learning journal.  
By committing regularly and solving exercises on my own, I’m:

- 📚 Reinforcing core programming concepts
- 💬 Building muscle memory through repetition
- 🧠 Understanding not just _what_ works, but _why_
- 🛠 Practicing professional version control workflows with Git
- 💼 Preparing for real-world software and data science roles

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.13 (installed via Homebrew)
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code (primary code editor)
- Terminal / iTerm2 with `zsh` and Oh My Zsh

---

## ✅ My Setup & Workflow

- SSH authentication set up for GitHub (no tokens needed)
- `.gitignore` used to exclude cache folders like `.ipynb_checkpoints/`
- Working in local repo, pushing updates section by section
- Committing early and often with clear messages
